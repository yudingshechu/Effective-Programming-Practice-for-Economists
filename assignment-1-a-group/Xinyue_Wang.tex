\subsection{Visio}
I am skilled at using Visio to design technical roadmaps and mind flow diagrams, which help to express ideas clearly and concisely,and to clarify essay structure.
For example:
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.1]{visio.jpg}
\end{center}

\subsection{R Language}
In the course \textit{Econometrics} and \textit{Computational Statistics}, I use R to do the basic sample regression, and generate data simulation of logistic and Lasso regression, test the consistency of Lasso estimator.

\subsection{Stata}
During my undergraduate program, I use Stata to conduct Lasso regression and panel data regression, which the analysis results are used to write thesis.

\subsection{Markdown}
I am adept at using Typora, which based on Markdown, to write and organize lecture notes.
