When it comes to the programming language, I used R-language, Python, Matlab, Stata and SQL before.
I mainly used R-language for applying machine learning skills in real-world data and doing some descriptive or predictive analysis. During the analysis process
there are several algorithms have been used, such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost, Gradient Boost, XGBoost and etc. Beside that, I also try to test the properties
of these algorithms, therefore some of simulation would be conducted and the set-up of data generating process of these simulation is based on some academic paper.
Additionally, I mainly used python for similar purpose but also used it for built up 
deep learning model for hand-written number recognition, text mining, and basic web crawling. For Matlab, I used it for solving some
problem about Euler equation and try to observe if the result would converge in the infinite term. For stata, I mainly used it in a course 
related to empirical banking. We used many methods to avoid the biased in regression, such as fixed effect and diff in diff. 
I used sql for learning how to built up a simple database.\newline 


\subsection{Table of my Programming level}
\begin{table}[H]
\caption{\textbf{Programming level}}
    \begin{tabular}{lccccr}
    \hline
    Programming Language & Python & R language & Matlab & Stata & SQL\\
    \hline \hline
    Level & Intermediate & Intermediate & Beginer & Intermediate & Beginer\\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{The formula I like the most recently}
\begin{equation*}
%$
x(t)\ =\ x_0e^{\int_{t_0}^{t}P(z)dz}+\int_{t_0}^{t}e^{\int_{s}^{t}P(z)dz}Q(s)ds
%$
\end{equation*}

This formula can help me to solve the first order differential equation such as following.
\begin{equation*}
X'(t) = P(t)x(t)+Q(t)
\end{equation*}
