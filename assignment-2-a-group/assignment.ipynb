    "# Exercise 2 - Functions, Modules and Namespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In this assignment you will use pre-commit hooks for the first time. They are there to help you to learn the python style conventions ([PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for code and [PEP257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) for docstrings) and us to grade your assignment. If your code is not compliant with the styleguides you will lose points. Do not forget to type `pre-commit install` in your shell, the first time you want to commit to the repository\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Please stick to the exact file and function names we ask you to use. Otherwise we will deduct points. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. This time the .gitignore file and tex template are already in the repository so it should be easy for you not to commit any generated files. If you have any generated files or folders under version control we will deduct points. This includes pdf files generated by LaTeX. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. In this assignment we will introduce you to docstrings. Docstrings are a short text that comes after the function definition and describes what the function does. Writing good docstrings is difficult and we do not expect yours to be perfect. However there are two simple rules that you have to follow if you do not want to lose points:\n",
    "    1. Every function that is defined at the top level (i.e. not inside another function) must have a docstring\n",
    "    2. The docstring describes all inputs and outputs of the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "From basic Microeconomics you know thethe Cobb Douglas production function given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = a \\cdot x_{1}^{\\gamma_1} x_{2}^{\\gamma_2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "in Python, this looks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def cobb_douglas(x1, x2, gamma1, gamma2, a):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Calculate the output of a Cobb-Douglas production function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Args:\n",
    "        x1 (float): First input factor\n",
    "        x2 (float): Second input factor\n",
    "        gamma1 (float): First exponent\n",
    "        gamma2 (float): Second exponent\n",
    "        a (float): Total factor productivity\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "        float: The output of the Cobb-Douglas production function\n",
    "        \n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    out = a * x1 ** gamma1 * x2 ** gamma2\n",
    "    return out\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "                 \n",
    "You have also seen the Leontief production given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = a \\cdot min\\{x_1, x_2\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production function contains the Cobb Douglas and Leontief functions as special cases. Moreover, it can be generalized to an arbitrary number of inputs. This function is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y =  a \\cdot \\left ( \\sum_{j=1}^J \\gamma_j x_j^{-\\rho} \\right )^{-\\frac{1}{\\rho}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Leontief function obtains if $\\rho$ approaches infinity. The Cobb Douglas Function obtains if $\\rho$ approaches 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your main task in this exercise will be to implement the CES production function in Python."

    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone this repository to your machine, if you have not already done so. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Think a bit about a good github workflow for the assignment that avoids merge conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create and activate the environment from `environment.yml` and run the pre-commit hooks by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "   `pre-commit install` and `pre-commit run`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In later assignments we will need production functions that accept arbitrary numbers of input factors. You will see that this flexibility is easy to implement in Python, especially if you use functional constructs. During this part you will work in `production_standalone.py`. As you know, you can execute python files py running `python file.py` in your shell.\n",
    "    - Rewrite the Cobb Douglas Function from above such that it accepts a list called `factors` of arbitrary length for the input factors, and a list called `weights` of the same length as parameters. The parameter `a` remains unchanged. The resulting function should have the following signature. Of course, do not forget to write a docstrings that reflects the new interface. \n",
    "    \n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        def general_cobb_douglas(factors, weights, a):\n",
    "            # actual code\n",
    "            return output\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    - Write a CES production functionthat also works for an arbitrary number of factors. The function signature should look like this:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        def general_ces(factors, weights, a, rho):\n",
    "            # actual code\n",
    "            return output\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    - You can verify that when $\\rho$ approaches zero, the output of the CES function is close to the output of the Cobb-Douglas function (no need to document this). However, when $\\rho$ is exactly equal to zero, the CES function is not defined. This can be very problematic if we want to estimate the parameters of a CES function. Write a function called `robust_general_ces` that is defined for $\\rho = 0$ and returns the limit of $\\rho \\rightarrow 0$ in this case. And remember: DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF!\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Verify that the functions do what they should. To do so, call the functions with input values for which you calculated the outputs by hand. Make sure that your code produces readable output. For this you can use code like the following:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        \n",
    "        cd_output = general_cobb_douglas(\n",
    "            factors=[1, 2, 3], \n",
    "            weights=[3, 2, 1],\n",
    "            a=2\n",
    "        )\n",
    "        expected_output = 24\n",
    "        \n",
    "        assert cd_output == expected_output\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        we recommend that you use integers as inputs to avoid roundoff errors. You will learn how to deal with roundoff errors is such a situation in later assignments.\n",
    "        \n",
    "5. Next we will share code across modules. For this purpose, we break up the existing file `production.py` into two separate parts.\n",
    "    - Copy the contents of `production_standalone.py` into two new modules: `production_functions.py` should contain all function definitions. `production_evaluations.py` contains the rest of the code.\n",
    "    - Write one paragraph (in a file called `solution.tex`) about the advantages of splitting up the code, especially in larger projects? You might find it helpful to read up on namespaces. If you want to find out which variables are defined in the namespaces of your modules or functions, you can use print statements like the following:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # print all local variables, excluding some built-in variables\n",
    "        print('\\n\\nLocal variables in INDICATE MODULE OR FUNCTION):')\n",
    "        item = ''\n",
    "        for item in sorted(locals()):\n",
    "            if not item.startswith('__'):\n",
    "                print(item)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # print all global variables, excluding some built-in variables\n",
    "        print('\\nGlobal variables in INDICATE MODULE OR FUNCTION:')\n",
    "        for item in sorted(globals()):\n",
    "            if not item.startswith('__'):\n",
    "                print(item)\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "      Note: You cannot put those print statements into a function as this would create a new namespace.\n",
    "          \n",
    "6. In the lecture you have heard about the differences of imperative, object oriented and functional programming and that functional programming has a lot of advantages for modern scientific computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer the following questions in LaTeX file called `solution.tex`. As last time, make sure the resulting PDF file is readable, well structured and makes clear to which question each answer belongs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Describe in less than 100 words what is meant by \"state\" in a programming context\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. As any programming paradigm, functional programming is a set of guidelines that can help you to reduce complexity in your code. One of the guidelines in functional programming is that functions must not have side effects. Explain briefly what a side effect is and why it should be avoided. Use a simple example to illustrate your answer but do not use the one from the lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. You have seen three functional constructs: map, filter and reduce. Describe what each of them does and how the same would be done in an imperative programming style (i.e. in a programming style where for loops, if-else statements and mutable objects are not discouraged). \n",
    "\n",
    "7. When you are satisfied with your solution, merge your branch into the master branch, and push the master branch to the central server. "
